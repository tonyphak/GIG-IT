# GIG-IT
Website for music fans to search for their favorite artist's upcoming events and shows. Also, a website for local bands to share their upcoming events and shows
## Motivation
We wanted to create a space for music fans to find their favorite artist's music events no matter which city they are in. We wanted to also create a space for local artist's to share their events no matter which city they are in. Hopefully, the music fans and local artists are able to find each other and share the music experience through the events.
